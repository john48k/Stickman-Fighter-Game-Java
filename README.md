# ‚öîÔ∏è Stick Man Fighter ü•ä

## Project Overview

Stick Man Fighter is a 2d Game built with java that we created as our final project in our Object Oriented Programming class.

Stick Man Fighter is a simple, hard-coded project, but it taught me invaluable lessons about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
The project involved developing game mechanics, character interactions, and a basic game loop, all while incorporating 
core OOP principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Although it was a straightforward endeavor, 
Stick Man Fighter served as a valuable learning experience, providing a solid foundation for my understanding of OOP.
